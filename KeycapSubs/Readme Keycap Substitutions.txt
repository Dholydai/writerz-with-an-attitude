Substitutions of common keycap sizes is required:

The 151-year-old mechanical typewriter keyboard core has a 1/2-1/4-1/2 rightward displacement
between the four straight rows of character keys. That was a mechanical requirement.

The 2025 Post-Mechanical Dvorak keyboards have an even 1/3-1/3-1/3 bilateral displacement.

A new class of keycap sizes are needed to build a perfected Post-Mechanical keyboard:

Requirements:     1+1/6U     1+1/3U     1+2/3U     1+5/6U     2+1/3U     2+2/3U
Substitutions:    1U         1.25U*     1.5U       1.75U      2.25U      2.5U
Trim to fit:                            1.75U**                          2.75U**

Note* For the two-hand PMs:

It is best to have a 1U 'Caps Lock" keycap to provide gaps separating it from the abutting
character keys, lessening accidental activations. This also allows light from the LED to
spread out from under the narrower keycap.

Note** For the Right/Left PMs:

The 2.5U key may be mythical. I have not acquired that keycap in any set that I have bought.

Substituting a 2.25U for a 2+2/3U creates large gaps between the keys. Trimming (filing) off
some of the side skirt of the 2.75U key and the abutting keys is aesthetically pleasing.

Doing the same trim for the 1.75U - 1+2/3U keycap substitution is also a good choice.
