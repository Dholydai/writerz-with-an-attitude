Human-factored writing instruments for 'Writerz with an Attitude'.

Why are writers born in the third decade of the 21st century still being shackled to a 19th-Century mechanical typewriter interface?

Do Qwerty lemmings ever question their orthodoxy? As a Dvorak user I have spent 35 years swimming against the current. It has been taxing.

I think that single-hand writers should use a keyboard when crafting written language. That skill is best experienced as a tactle exercise.

1. I have designed new sleek cases, no more chunky boxes.
2. My latest keyboards use an RP2040 Elite-Pi controller.
3. The new PCB designs fit the new case.
4. The 60 percent and three compact variant PCBs are compatable with the Elite-C and Elite-Pi.

All of my compact keyboards are in the new case now, as is the ambidexterous 60 percent variant.

My sister (a Qwerty touch-typer) evaluated a TKL. As a result of her critique:

1. The USB port has been redesigned to make 'blind' plugging-in easy. All varients have been upgraded. 
2. The TKL is scrapped for new full-sized variants, 106-key and 109-key.
3. The Jumbo and Maximus use the Elite-Pi. It has the 25 PIOs needed to include a Num Lock and Caps Lock LEDs.

The big keyboards are working; however, the seven section case has presented problems: It will not sit nicely.

1. I tried using Gateron switches on these builds. The key caps end up jacked around at all angles. The parts must be crooked!
2. Cherry MX switches never exhibited this poor quality. So I will build two more big keyboards with Cherry switches.
3. The case has been redesigned to allow the PCB more room and the sidewall mating surfaces have been tweaked in OpenSCAD.

When the case problems are solved I will publish the case designs.
