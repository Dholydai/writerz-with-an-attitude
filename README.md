Why are writers born in the third decade of the 21st century still being shackled to a 19th-Century mechanical typewriter interface?

Been using a Dvorak keyboard for thirty-five years. The Dvorak 2025 has the keys placed where my fingers expect them to be.

Built a Qwerty for my sister, never again. She is happier using her old keyboard. Inhabitants of the Qwertyverse are a blissful lot. 

Single-hand writers should have use of a modern writing instrument. August Dvorak designed thoughful single-hand letter schemes.

1. New slim as possible PCB designs were developed to fit new sleek cases.
2. All of my keyboards use an RP2040 Elite-Pi controller, with KMK firmware.
3. All variants now have LED indicators (Caps Lock, Num Lock)
4. The Sixty percent keyboard has two 'Fn' LEDs for layer indication (working to create the code).  

My sister evaluated a TKL. As a result of her critique:

1. The USB port has been redesigned to make 'blind' plugging-in easier. 
2. The TKL is scrapped for a new full-sized variant, the 109-key Maximus.

Quality of key switches:

1. I built two full-sized keyboards with Gateron switches... never again! The switches are deformed; key caps are jacked at all angles. 
2. Cherry MX switches have great quality. Never had a problem with them. I now build all of my keyboards with Cherry switches.
3. The 3D printed case designs have been tweaked in OpenSCAD to insure that the sidewall mating surfaces meet perfectly.

Availability of keycap sets:

I have been subsituting common keycaps sizes from large XDA keycapy sets, and relabeling them with keycap stickers as needed.

YUZU custom keycaps makes any die-sub keycap set that your heart desires. I have designed and bought five sets in two months. Even
with the new high tariffs, the price is a affordable. Good quality product.

Maximus case problem:

The case would not sit flat on a desktop. After over a month of struggle to get the problem solved, I have learned that:

1. My Voron Trident cannot print good case bottom sections. By fluke of design, they were adequate enough for two-section case bottoms. 
2. This is no reflection on Voron Design, this problem is intrinsic to all CoreXY printers; well-built bed slingers do not have this fault.
3. My Prusa MK3.5 has a new companion... a Prusa MK4S. The new printer makes parts that match-up perfectly with the MK 3.5 parts.  
4. Print times for case bottom sections changed dramatically: from 3hs 15 mins to 1 hr 45 mins. I am now a committed Prusa fanatic.
