Why are writers born in the third decade of the 21st century still being shackled to a 19th-Century mechanical typewriter interface?

Fifty-five years ago, I rejected the Qwerty typewriter, the letter arrangement is stupid. I began using a Dvorak keyboard thirty-five years ago.

I built a Qwerty for my sister, her feedback helped me refine my keyboard and case designs. I asked for it back after realizing the she was happier
using her old keyboard. Inhabitants of the Qwertyverse are a blissful lot. In good conscience, I will never build another Qwerty.

I believe that single-hand writers should use a keyboard when crafting written language. That skill is best experienced as a tactle exercise.

1. I have designed new sleek cases, no more chunky boxes.
2. All of my keyboards now use an RP2040 Elite-Pi controller.
3. New slim PCB designs were developed to fit the new case.
4. All variants now have LED indicators (Caps Lock, Num Lock)
5. The Sixty percent keyboard has two 'Fn' LEDs for layer indication (working to create the code).  

My sister evaluated a TKL. As a result of her critique:

1. The USB port has been redesigned to make 'blind' plugging-in easier. 
2. The TKL is scrapped for a new full-sized variant, the 109-key Maximus.

Quality of key switches:

1. I built two full-sized keyboards with Gateron switches... never again! The switches are deformed; key caps are jacked at all angles. 
2. Cherry MX switches have great quality. Never had a problem with them. I now build all of my keyboards with Cherry switches.
3. The 3D printed case desigs have been tweaked in OpenSCAD to insure that the mating surfaces meet perfectly.

After months of struggle to get the Maximus case fit problems solved (the case would not sit flat on a desktop), I have learned that:

1. My Voron Trident cannot print exactingly square parts. By fluke of my design methods, those parts worked well enough for compact cases. 
2. This is no reflection on Voron Design, this problem is intrinsic to all CoreXY printers; well-built bed slingers do not have this fault.
3. My Prusa MK3.5 has a new companion... a Prusa MK4S. The new printer makes parts that match-up perfectly with the MK 3.5 parts.  
4. Print times for case bottom sections changed dramatically: from 3hs 15 mins to 1 hr 45 mins! I am now a dedicated Prusa snob.
