Why are writers born in the third decade of the 21st century still being shackled to an injurious 19th-Century mechanical typewriter interface?

I have been a Dvorak keyboard user for thirty-five years. After two decades of typing bad pains developed in my left hand and wrist. Analyzing 
my breakdown, I concluded that the physical arrangement of the keys on conventional keyboards is unnatural.

I designed the Dvorak 2025 to place the keys where the fingers of my two hands expect them to be. I no longer have pain, writing is great fun.

I built a Qwerty variant for my sister... never again. She is happier using her old keyboard. Inhabitants of the Qwertyverse are a blissful lot. 

Single-hand writers should have use of modern writing instruments. After World War 2, many of August Dvorak's fellow veterans lost the use of an
arm. When a disabled vet asked LCDR Dvorak for help, he designed two thoughful single-hand letter schemes for the typewriter.

My new compact single-hand keyboard designs have a few notable tweaks, but do not stray too far from the original designs. Both variants now share 
the same letter scheme. The left-hand and right-hand keyboards are mirror images of each other.

Changes from my previous work:

1. New slim as possible PCB designs were developed to fit new sleek as possible cases.
2. All of my keyboards now use an RP2040 Elite-Pi controller, with KMK firmware.
3. All variants now have LED indicators (Caps Lock, Num Lock)
4. The Sixty percent keyboard has two additional 'Fn' LEDs for layer indication (working to create the code).
5. Case designs now insure that 3D printing artifacts do not prevent the sections' mating surfaces from meeting perfectly.  

My sister evaluated a TKL. As a result of her critique:

1. The USB port has been redesigned to make 'blind' plugging-in easier. 
2. The TKL has been scrapped for a new full-sized variant, the 109-key Maximus.

Quality of key switches:

1. I built two full-sized keyboards with Gateron switches... never again! They are deformed; key caps are jacked around at all angles. 
2. Cherry MX switches have great quality. Never had a problem with them. Going forward, I build all of my keyboards with Cherry switches.

Availability of keycap sets:

I have been subsituting common keycaps sizes from large XDA keycapy sets, and relabeling them with keycap stickers as needed.

YUZU custom keycaps makes any die-sub keycap set that your heart desires. Common sizes still have to be sustituted. Being able to choose 
keycap sizes, colors, and legends is 'just what the doctor ordered'. I have designed and bought five sets in two months. Even
with the new high tariffs, the price is a affordable. Good quality product.

Maximus case problem:

The case would not sit flat on a desktop. After over a month of struggle to get the problem solved, I have learned that:

1. My Voron Trident cannot print good case bottom sections. By fluke of design, they were adequate enough for two-section case bottoms. 
2. This is no reflection on Voron Design, this problem is intrinsic to all CoreXY printers; well-built bed slingers do not have this fault.
3. My Prusa MK3.5 has a new companion... a Prusa MK4S. The new printer makes parts that match-up perfectly with the MK 3.5 parts.  
4. Print times for case bottom sections changed dramatically: from 3hs 15 mins to 1 hr 45 mins. I am now a committed Prusa fanatic.
