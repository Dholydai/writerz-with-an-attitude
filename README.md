Ronald Earl Walker - Inventor of the Post-Mechanical Keyboard

1. I will adding a full-size 105-key writing instrument this year.
2. Also build my next keyboards using a RP2040 Elite-Pi controller.
3. The new PCBs have seven M3 mounting holes each.
4. I will design a new minimalist case to use the PCB with mounting holes.
