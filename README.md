Human-factored writing instruments for 'Writerz with an Attitude'.

Why are writers born in the third decade of the 21st century still being shackled to a 19th-Century mechanical typewriter interface?

Do Qwerty lemmings ever question their orthodoxy? No, swimming against the current is very taxing.

I think that single-hand writers should use a keyboard when crafting written language. That skill is best experienced as a tactle exercise.

Introducing my new sleek cases, no more chunky boxes.

1. My next keyboards will have an RP2040 Elite-Pi controller.
2. The new PCBs designs fit the new case. Each has seven M3 mounting holes, to fit a minimalist case.
3. All of my compact keyboards are in the new case now.
