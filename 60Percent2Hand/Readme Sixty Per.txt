Separate codes for left and right 60% keyboards would required swapping of
the 'Fn' and 'Menu' keys.

So, it seemed better to make a keyboard with a left and a right 'Fn' key. Left
key activates a right-hand layer, the right key activates a left-hand layer.

The ambidextrous code is well-behaved on keyboard test websites. Good code.

However, it is confusing: What 'Fn' key was pressed? What layer is active?

So the PCB design now includes provision for LED indicators under the 'Fn' keys.

Working on the KMK code to support those layer indicators.
